*Textture*使用

##核心概念

界面状态

**Preload**: The furthest range out from being visible. This is where content is gathered from an external source, whether that’s some API or a local disk.
**Display**: Here, display tasks such as text rasterization and image decoding take place.
**Visble**: The node is onscreen by at least one pixel.

*Interface State Callbacks*
Visible Range

```
-didEnterVisibleState
-didExitVisibleState

```
Display Range

```
-didEnterDisplayState
-didExitDisplayState

```

Preload Range

```
-didEnterPreloadState
-didExitPreloadState

##节点容器(Node Containers)
在节点容器中使用节点

Texture Node Container |  UIKit Equivalent
---------------|--------------------------
ASCollectionNode | UIKit's UICollectionView
ASPageNode | UIKit's UIPageViewController
ASTableNode | UIKit's UITableView 
ASViewController | UIViewController
ASNavigationController | in place of UIKit's UINavigationController. Implements the **ASVisibility protocol**.
ASTabBarController | in place of UIKit's UITabBarController. Implements the **ASVisibility protocol**.

使用节点容器的好处
节点容器自动的管理节点的智能预加载.
This means that all of the node’s layout measurement, data fetching, decoding and rendering will be done asynchronously. Among other conveniences, this is why it is recommended to use nodes within a container node


```
	Note that while it is possible to use nodes directly (without an Texture node container), unless you add additional calls, they will only start displaying once they come onscreen (as UIKit does). This can lead to performance degredation and flashing of content.
```

**-init**

```
	This method is called on a background thread when using nodeBlocks. Don't have a lock in this method. Most notably, this means you should never initialize any UIKit objects, touch the view or layer of a node(e.g. node.layer.X or node.view.X) or add any gesture recognizers in your initializer. Instead, do these things in -didLoad.
```

**-didLoad**

```
	This method is conceptually similar to UIViewController’s -viewDidLoad method; it’s called once and is the point where the backing view has been loaded. It is guaranteed to be called on the main thread and is the appropriate place to do any UIKit things (such as adding gesture recognizers, touching the view / layer, initializing UIKit objects).
```

**layoutSpecThatFits**

```
	This method defines the layout and does the heavy calculation on a background thread. This method is where you build out a layout spec object that will produce the size of the node, as well as the size and position of all subnodes. This is where you will put the majority of your layout code.
	The layout spec object that you create is malleable up until the point that it is return in this method. After this point, it will be immutable. It’s important to remember not to cache layout specs for use later but instead to recreate them when necessary.
	Because it is run on a background thread, you should not set any node.view or node.layerproperties here. Also, unless you know what you are doing, do not create any nodes in this method. Additionally, it is not neccessary to begin this method with a call to super, unlike other method overrides.

```
**layout**

```
	The call to super in this method is where the results of the layoutSpec are applied; Right after the call to super in this method, the layout spec will have been calculated and all subnodes will have been measured and positioned.
	-layout is conceptually similar to UIViewController’s -viewWillLayoutSubviews. This is a good spot to change the hidden property, set view based properties if needed (not layoutable properties) or set background colors. You could put background color setting in -layoutSpecThatFits:, but there may be timing problems. If you happen to be using any UIViews, you can set their frames here. However, you can always create a node wrapper with -initWithViewBlock: and then size this on the background thread elsewhere.
	This method is called on the main thread. However, if you are using layout Specs, you shouldn’t rely on this method too much, as it is much preferable to do layout off the main thread. Less than 1 in 10 subclasses will need this.
One great use of -layout is for the specific case in which you want a subnode to be your exact size. E.g. when you want a collectionNode to take up the full screen. This case is not supported well by layout specs and it is often easiest to set the frame manually with a single line in this method:

```

###ASViewController
An ASViewController is a regular UIViewController subclass that has special features to manage nodes. Since it is a UIViewController subclass, all methods are called on the **main thread** (and you should always create an ASViewController on the main thread).

**init**

```
	This method is called once, at the very beginning of an ASViewController’s lifecycle. As with UIViewController initialization, it is best practice to never access self.view or self.node.view in this method as it will force the view to be created early. Instead, do any view access in -viewDidLoad.
	ASViewController’s designated initializer is initWithNode:. A typical initializer will look something like the code below. Note how the ASViewController’s node is created before calling super. An ASViewController manages a node similarly to how a UIViewController manages a view, but the initialization is slightly different.

```

```
- (instancetype)init
{
  _pagerNode = [[ASPagerNode alloc] init];
  self = [super initWithNode:_pagerNode];
  
  // setup any instance variables or properties here
  if (self) {
    _pagerNode.dataSource = self;
    _pagerNode.delegate = self;
  }
  
  return self;
}

```

**loadView**

```
	We recommend that you do not use this method because it is has no particular advantages over -viewDidLoad and has some disadvantages. However, it is safe to use as long as you do not set the self.view property to a different value. The call to [super loadView] will set it to the node.view for you.

```

**viewDidLoad**

```
	This method is called once in a ASViewController’s lifecycle, immediately after -loadView. This is the earliest time at which you should access the node’s view. It is a great spot to put any setup code that should only be run once and requires access to the view/layer, such as adding a gesture recognizer.
	Layout code should never be put in this method, because it will not be called again when geometry changes. Note this is equally true for UIViewController; it is bad practice to put layout code in this method even if you don’t currently expect geometry changes.

```

**viewWillLayoutSubviews**

```
	This method is called at the exact same time as a node’s -layout method and it may be called multiple times in a ASViewController’s lifecycle; it will be called whenever the bounds of the ASViewController’s node are changed (including rotation, split screen, keyboard presentation) as well as when there are changes to the hierarchy (children being added, removed, or changed in size).
	For consistency, it is best practice to put all layout code in this method. Because it is not called very frequently, even code that does not directly depend on the size belongs here.

```

**viewWillAppear: / -viewDidDisappear**

```
	These methods are called just before the ASViewController’s node appears on screen (the earliest time that it is visible) and just after it is removed from the view hierarchy (the earliest time that it is no longer visible). These methods provide a good opportunity to start or stop animations related to the presentation or dismissal of your controller. This is also a good place to make a log of a user action.
	Although these methods may be called multiple times and geometry information is available, they are not called for all geometry changes and so should not be used for core layout code (beyond setup required for specific animations).

```

##Layout
###Basic Concepts
Texture’s layout system is centered around two basic concepts:

* Layout specs
* Layout Elements

####Layout Specs

```
	A layout spec, short for “layout specification”, has no physical presence. Instead, layout specs act as containers for other layout elements by understanding how these children layout elements relate to each other.
Texture provides several subclasses of ASLayoutSpec, from a simple layout specification that insets a single child, to a more complex layout specification that arranges multiple children in varying stack configurations.

```
**ASInsetLayoutSpec**
**ASCornerLayoutSpec**
**ASStackLayoutSpec**
**ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec**
**ASOverlayLayoutSpec**
**ASBackgroundLayoutSpec**
**SWrapperLayoutSpec**
**ASCenterLayoutSpec**
**ASRatioLayoutSpec**
**ASRelativeLayoutSpec**

####Layout Elements

```
	Layout specs contain and arrange layout elements.
All ASDisplayNodes and ASLayoutSpecs conform to the <ASLayoutElement> protocol. This means that you can compose layout specs from both nodes and other layout specs. Cool!
	The ASLayoutElement protocol has several properties that can be used to create very complex layouts. In addition, layout specs have their own set of properties that can be used to adjust the arrangment of the layout elements.

```

####Layout Debugging
	Calling -asciiArtString on any ASDisplayNode or ASLayoutSpec returns an ascii-art representation of the object and its children. Optionally, if you set the .debugName on any node or layout spec, that will also be included in the ascii art. An example is seen below.
	
```
-----------------------ASStackLayoutSpec----------------------
|  -----ASStackLayoutSpec-----  -----ASStackLayoutSpec-----  |
|  |       ASImageNode       |  |       ASImageNode       |  |
|  |       ASImageNode       |  |       ASImageNode       |  |
|  ---------------------------  ---------------------------  |
--------------------------------------------------------------

```

You can also print out the style object on any ASLayoutElement (node or layout spec). This is especially useful when debugging the sizing properties.

```
(lldb) po _photoImageNode.style
Layout Size = min {414pt, 414pt} <= preferred {20%, 50%} <= max {414pt, 414pt}

```
